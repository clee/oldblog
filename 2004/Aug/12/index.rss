    <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, lots of news since last time I blogged. First off, sorry about the server being down; apparently we had a hardware failure on the machine that my blog and planet KDE are both hosted on, and I was ill-prepared for it; my mail was down for a few hours, as well, which was no good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steph got hired as a nanny in New York. She&apos;s moving her stuff out this weekend. I&apos;m excited for her - I think she&apos;s going to do an awesome job as a nanny, and she&apos;s great with kids; but I&apos;m also really going to miss her. Steph is awesome, and the apartment isn&apos;t going to be the same without her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other news, we went down to Long Island last weekend. I had a blast; it felt so great to be home again, and I got to see a couple of my friends. We went to the beach at Smith Point and I got my ass kicked by the waves. I still have a couple of sand burns on my back to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;caillon, J5, maureen, and halfline came over last night. There was hookah and Gamecube, and much rejoicing. Found a smoke shop in Salem, NH that sells shisha, and I picked up two packs of grape. If it&apos;s good, I&apos;ll be going back frequently; if it&apos;s not, I guess it&apos;s back to ordering from the internet. I don&apos;t know why, but there&apos;s just something satisfying about the whole instant gratification thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
