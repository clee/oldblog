    <description>&lt;p&gt;Stroking is hard. So hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I hear the word &apos;stroke&apos; from now on, I&apos;m going to hear keithp purr. That disturbs me to no end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other news, the DDC at OLS has been a lot of fun. I&apos;m going to have to disagree with chouimat about a few things - namely, I think that Xgl is extremely sexy, and has a hell of a future, and while it&apos;s true that the vast majority of the talks here are GNOME-related or have a GNOME bias... it&apos;s because we are vastly outnumbered on this side of the pond, and you can count the number of KDE developers at this conference on one hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Staikos was here for a couple of hours, I&apos;ve been here for the DDC but not OLS, chouimat was here (but let&apos;s face it, you haven&apos;t been active in KDE lately, chouimat, and neither have I), and Alexander Dymo is here and gave a talk about KDevelop. We&apos;re not exactly taking over here. We need more of a presence at these shows, people. It&apos;s important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
