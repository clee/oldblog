    <description>&lt;p&gt;Some asshole thought it would be a good idea to string up yellow &quot;CAUTION&quot; tape and block one of the one-way roads leading to my apartment building inside of the complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not amused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stopped my car, pulled up the handbrake, flipped on the emergency lights, got out, and walked to one side of the tape. I ripped it off, and some guy screamed out &quot;HEY!!!&quot; I turned to his general direction and flipped him off, and walked across the street to the other side, where I pulled down the rest of the tape and tossed it into my car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Got back into my car and parked in my parking lot without incident, throwing out the tape on my way in to my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God dammit, I hate people sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
