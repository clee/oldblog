    <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of things going on lately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, most recently, I started hacking on &lt;a href=&quot;http://c133.org/tmp/tdfx-exa.patch&quot;&gt;EXA support for the tdfx driver&lt;/a&gt; - it doesn&apos;t do much yet, except for display things wrong and crash, but hopefully I&apos;m not too far from it working properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, I finally coerced a graphic designer friend of mine into coming up with a new layout for my site. It&apos;s not live yet, because I&apos;m not quite happy with it, but it&apos;s pretty close to ready (I think) - &lt;a href=&quot;http://c133.org/c133/&quot;&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:clee@c133.org&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt; what you think. (Yeah, I know, it&apos;s slow. It&apos;s using multiple layers of translucent PNGs, some of which are position: fixed. I prefer to think of it as &quot;an opportunity for KHTML optimization.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, I have been hacking on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.qtdeveloper.net/archives/2005/07/26/&quot;&gt;Qt4 BitTorrent client from Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, and it&apos;s really cool. There&apos;s a very small, slow memory leak in it, though, which I have to find and destroy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than that, not too much going on. I&apos;m excited about aKademy - only a couple of weeks away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
