    <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally feels like things are going places. I just got back from a great week and a half in Arizona on Wednesday night; for whatever reason, I came down with a fever almost immediately after I got back, which included a really nasty throat condition where it hurt to swallow. Fever broke a day or two ago, but the throat still hurts. Nasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time since I can remember, Arizona was actually &lt;u&gt;fun&lt;/u&gt; to be in. I had a BLAST. Kyle came down from Colorado; I got to see pretty much every single one of my friends; I got &lt;a href=&quot;http://c133.org/img/armband.jpg&quot;&gt;a tattoo&lt;/a&gt;; and I did some other things which I&apos;m quite proud of, but which aren&apos;t fit to print, especially not on a public blog like this. I even got to say &quot;goodbye&quot; to a few of my old teachers from high school, which was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, to top it all off, I move into my new apartment on Tuesday (yeah, I got approved!) and two weeks from that, I start at redhat. Even cooler is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://fooishbar.org/daniel/blog/&quot;&gt;daniels&lt;/a&gt; is coming up on July 11th, and we&apos;re gonna go crash OLS and kick some ass in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and apparently (according to Steph) I&apos;ve become some sort of a pimp. Can&apos;t argue with that. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
