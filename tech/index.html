			<p>When I first heard that the iPhone had a camera built-in, as well as WiFi, those two features triggered the following thought:</p><p><blockquote>It would be really hot if you could upload the pictures from the camera directly to Flickr.</blockquote></p><p>When I got my iPhone, I figured out a workflow that I could use to post pictures from the phone to my Flickr account, but it <strike>totally sucked balls</strike> was less than optimal. For each picture I wanted to upload, I had to open the picture in the Photos app and email it to a special address that Flickr had associated with my account.</p><p>Negatives of this approach? Impossible to use for more than a couple of images at a time, primarily, but also, annoyingly, the Mail app on the iPhone scales and recompresses the JPEG images before sending - and it strips them of their EXIF data, too.</p><p>So I was mildly displeased, but there was a way I could get it to work, kinda.</p><p>Then the iPhone got cracked wide open. People started figuring out how to write third-party apps and get them installed on their iPhones, and - to be honest - the UI for it, via Installer.app, is - even though it's not from Apple - better than anything I've seen on any other mobile phone, ever.</p><p>The Friday before last (September 7th), I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands. Finally learn Objective C. Start writing my dedicated "Push all of the images in my Camera Roll to Flickr, right now dammit" application. And I got a pretty good start! Got the toolchain to build working iPhone apps, and that only took a few hours. Started reading through Flickr's API documentation. Started implementing some functions that didn't require authorization to call - learning how to use Flickr's REST API, basically. Once the first couple of unauthenticated calls worked and did what I expected, I knew it would only be a matter of time before I had my app working.</p><p>And then someone pointed me to <a href="http://http://code.google.com/p/iflickr/">iFlickr</a>.</p><p>My first thought was "Dammit, somebody beat me to it." And I was a little depressed for a bit.</p><p>I downloaded it and tried to get it working. No offense to the iFlickr devs, but they clearly didn't put a lot of thought into the user experience (or if they did, I posit that their ideas about "good user experience" work completely differently from mine). I didn't end up getting it to work, but it's open-source, right?</p><p>Naturally, my next thought: "Well, I've been working on mine, and this doesn't really do what I wanted. But... maybe I can steal some of their code at least!"</p><p>And then I looked at the code.</p><p>My eyes still burn a little bit from that. That ... that was not a good idea. I've had much better ideas in the past.</p><p>I worked on this for the next few nights, realized that I could completely avoid the messy minitoken crap by using the "Desktop app" authentication mode from Flickr, deleted all of my code that dealt with mini-tokens, and the other night, I finally got it to actually upload pictures to my Flickr account. (My friend <a href="http://cliffhacks.blogspot.com/">Cliff</a>'s help was so valuable as to be incalculable.)</p><p>I'll post more technical details later, but the important thing is: <a href="http://mobilepushr.jottit.com/">MobilePushr</a> is out. The UI is going to get a lot of love in the next few days, because the current one doesn't provide nearly enough feedback, but as of right now, MobilePushr lets me do something that I've wanted for almost three months. </p><p>I can push my JPEGs directly from my iPhone to my Flickr account with the push of a single, giant red button. (And so can you! If you go download it and install it on your iPhone, that is. Assuming you have an iPhone.)</p><p>Also, of course, MobilePushr is Open Source / Free Software, released under the GPLv2. If you use git, you can look at my code by cloning git://mg8.org/MobilePushr and poking around.</p><p>The really awesome thing about all of this is that, through Flickr, I can see how many people have given my app permission to link to their account, and in the first twelve hours alone over a thousand people have activated support for MobilePushr on their Flickr accounts.</p><p>I don't even have words to describe how awesome that makes me feel.<br /></p>

			<p>I hit another case of "Python really makes me angry" today and I thought I would share it with you all, since I know how much you love reading about things that enrage me.</p><p>I have a chunk of code that (while being significantly more complex) looks like this:<br /><pre>def baz():<br />    print kitties # This works fine.</p><p>def bar():<br />    print kitties # This one throws an exception!</p><p>    kitties = 'delicious' # The exception is because of this.</p><p>def foo():<br />    stuff = {'kitties': 'squishy'}</p><p>    for k, v in stuff.iteritems():<br />        globals()[k] = v</p><p>    baz()<br />    bar()<br /></pre></p><p>This is another example of Python's scoping being weird, and in my opinion, broken.</p><p>Let me explain, in case you didn't bother copy & pasting that into a python shell and running it.</p><p><code>baz()</code> will execute properly. <code>bar()</code> will not. But the error you get from <code>bar()</code> is worthless - it tells you that you're trying to read from an unassigned local variable, except you're trying to read from a global variable. The problem I have is not that <code>bar()</code> fails - it's that it is inconsistent with <code>baz()</code> working. I realize that adding a <code>global kitties</code> makes <code>bar()</code> work properly; but I think that in this case, the error should really be when you try to reassign a global variable that hasn't been declared as global.<br /></p>

		<div class="text">
			<p>I really love it when I can easily find something that bothers me in a piece of software, dive into the source, and start fixing things.</p><p>That's what I've been doing lately with this <a href="http://handbrake.m0k.org/">little DVD ripping app called HandBrake</a> - it's a cross-platform GPL DVD ripper that makes it almost painfully easy to take a movie from a DVD and turn it into a file that you can watch whenever the need strikes you.</p><p>There are some problems, though. Right off the bat, there is the issue that (when ripping a DVD) libdvdread spews out hundreds of lines of output, warning me that a value isn't 0 and it should be. It's not fatal, but it certainly is annoying, so I whipped up <a href="http://c133.org/tmp/libhb-dvd.diff">this patch</a> up to fix it.</p><p>Also, I don't have a video iPod at the moment, or a Sony PSP (and I don't see myself buying the latter anytime soon, but you know... if one were to fall into my lap, I'd probably use it and enjoy the hell out of it.) Anyway, not owning one of these devices, I'm more interested in HandBrake as a way to make high-quality compressed archives of my DVD movies that I can watch on the HDTV in the living room. There's a problem, though; HandBrake scales the picture by default as it transcodes it.</p><p><a href="http://c133.org/tmp/enc-pixelratio.diff">Not anymore</a>, it doesn't. Now it has support for (optionally) embedding the anamorphic pixel ratio into the output file, and can preserve the original DVD video frames. Which means, with x264 at least, a reasonable performance increase of about 15%. Not too shabby!</p><p>Unfortunately, the only GUIs for HandBrake are on Mac OS X and BeOS. Now, I love BeOS. Haven't used it in years, though, and I don't even think it'll run on my hardware; Haiku still isn't quite there yet, either, but I'm keeping tabs on it. What I really wanted is a Linux UI for HandBrake.</p><p>So, I've been hacking on one.</p><p><img src="http://c133.org/qhandbrake-1.png" alt="Qt4 HandBrake UI" /></p><p>Stay tuned for more on this...<br /></p>

Unfortunately, Linux doesn't have ZFS, and OpenSolaris doesn't seem to have AOE yet. (The Coraid site has a Solaris driver, and they claim it works on Solaris 7+, but there is no source and I don't happen to have an OpenSolaris machine to test it on at the moment.)</p><p>But - the ability to pool together all of my disparate disks into one gigantic volume is awesome.

For example, the hack that the PalmOS guys are using for showing focus selection? It breaks with at least half of the color themes that they ship on the device, because it doesn't draw the halo properly on the buttons. And the fact that I can't create my *own* color theme annoys me, too.</p><p>I <b>need</b> to figure out some way to get Graffiti 1 working on this thing. I'm using a demo version of TealScript for now but it's a little on the slow side and I don't really like the idea of paying $30 for it, especially since it's *not* a faithful reproduction.</p><p>Sync works great over Bluetooth to my Mac mini, which is pleasing.

			<p>I decided that I was sick of paying too much money for my cell phone and so I've initiated a transfer of my cell phone number from Sprint/Nextel to Vonage.</p><p>Vonage assigned me a temporary number in the meanwhile, which is cool, and I've been playing with the service.</p><p>I have to say that I'm <b>really</b> pleased with it so far.</p><p>Installation was literally a snap - I unpacked the router they sent me (the Linksys RTP300), plugged in the power, and scratched my head over what I should do next. I figured that I'd probably have to do some port forwarding magic or something if I wanted it to work from behind the router, so I punted on that and went to Target to pick up a handset since I haven't ever owned a "real" phone.</p><p>Bought a $9 handset at Target, a GE "Slimline" thing that has call waiting, caller ID, three-way calling, and other things that are insane for a $9 phone. Anyway. I brought it back home, plugged it (and the ethernet cable) into my RTP300, and then mentally prepared myself for the frustration of having to do magic to get my main router to let the new toy do its thing.</p><p>I was a little disappointed, actually.</p><p>It just worked. No port forwarding, no iptables hackery, no headaches, no frustration - the lights flickered in a few weird patterns for a minute or so, and then I picked up the handset and I got a dial tone. I dialed my phone number and it asked me to log in to my voicemail.</p><p>Consider me impressed. Not to mention that the web-based UI for managing the Vonage account is really really sweet - I have it set to send me email when I get a new voicemail, and you can check your voicemails from the web (they show up as WAV files), plus it's dead simple to set up call forwarding and configure the different timeouts for voicemail/call forwarding/etc.</p><p>So, I don't know about the other routers - I've read lots of nightmare story reports from people using other hardware and things - or other phones or other VoIP providers, but so far I'm pretty damned impressed with Vonage. Oh, and for $25/month, I get unlimited calls to anywhere in North America, including Canada, and their international rates are pretty good, too. I called <a href="http://fooishbar.org/">daniels</a> up the other day and the conversation - which lasted for almost an hour - cost less than a combo meal at Burger King.</p><p>Pretty sure the future is made out of <b>awesome</b>.<br /></p>

			<p>Today is a pretty cool day for me because a project I've been working on at work is finally released.</p><p><a href="http://people.redhat.com/zcerza/dogtail/"><img class="rapemewithachainsawthanks" src="http://people.redhat.com/zcerza/dogtail/images/dogtail01.jpg" alt="Dogtail!" /></a></p><p>dogtail is a framework written in Python which makes it easy to write scripts to automate graphical applications. It uses AT-SPI which means that (for now) it doesn't work with KDE, but I fought the good fight to make sure that it has no GNOME dependencies so that hopefully there will be a chance of KDE adopting it in the future. Now that we've finally gotten the release out the door, I plan to track KDE svn and write scripts for KDE4 apps. Ideally, we'll have KDE4 support before KDE4 is actually released.</p><p>(I know that there's a tool from <a href="http://wwww.klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se/">KDAB</a> which allows one to automate KDE apps, but it's not Open Source and it only works with KDE; dogtail supports anything that we can see through AT-SPI, which includes OpenOffice.org and Mozilla-based applications as well as, hopefully, KDE4.)<br /></p>

			<p><a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/1465">Fab</a>: NetworkManager actually has a pretty well-designed separation between the front-end and the back-end; the only problem stalling us from being able to do cool things with it right now is that we have no working DBUS bindings for KDE3 (so nobody can easily write a Kicker applet to interface with NetworkManager to use on their desktop <b>today</b>), and KDE4 doesn't actually have anything usable at this point, whatsoever.</p><p>I brought this up at aKademy - aseigo and I were basically ready to go ahead with it but we got sidetracked with window icon previews in the window list on the desktop pager hover tooltip. (Try saying that five times fast.)</p><p>In theory, somebody could write the applet using the DBUS API from C, but the current Qt bindings in the DBUS tree are pretty much worthless, so it's not going to be pretty either way.<br /></p>

I mean, uh, what robots? I don't have any robots.</p><p>I do have three totally awesome computers now, though (not including my work laptop). The first one is my Mac mini, which rules, but it's not the focus of this entry.</p><p>Over the past week or so, I'd run into some really odd stability issues with my AMD64 box. I decided to go to CompUSA and pick up a new motherboard, since the last issue I had with an AMD64 machine was also the mobo. Bring the new mobo back home. Remove the old one, move parts over to new one, hook up power connectors, flip the switch, and ... nothing.</p><p>The damned thing didn't even POST.</p><p>Somewhat frustrated, I decided to work on assembling my other new system. I've had a spare CPU, some extra RAM, and a slew of video cards laying around for a while now, so the only thing I really needed to pick up was a new case and a motherboard for this box. It's an "old" AthlonXP 1700+ - I figure it's probably worth me keeping a system around that can do AGP and run fast enough to prevent me from throwing it out the window.</p><p>The assembly on my new system went pretty well, until the part where I attempted to attach the power cable. The power supply I was using was a 24-pin, designed for the power requirements of the newer AMD64 systems. Normally, it wouldn't be too hard to plug in a 24-pin cable into the 20-pin socket on the motherboard, except that the mobo I picked up happens to have the IDE pins right next to the ATX pins.</p><p>And there was much frustration.</p><p>I was about to give up, but for some reason I decided to read the manual for the power supply in the new case that showed up, and if you look at page 3 in <a href="http://www.antec.com/pdf/manuals/SmartPower2_En.pdf">the manual</a>, you should see the picture that made my night.</p><p>The other power supply can break off the extra four pins so that I can use it on the motherboard.</p><p>I returned to CompUSA and got a replacement for the busted motherboard, and brought it home and set it up, and this one actually works, so now I've got both systems up and running beautifully.</p><p>My only issue now is that I need a DVI/USB KVM.<br /></p>

(Yeah, I know, it's slow. It's using multiple layers of translucent PNGs, some of which are position: fixed.

There's a very small, slow memory leak in it, though, which I have to find and destroy.</p><p>Other than that, not too much going on.

			<p>Red Hat, my employer, has a site license for VMware. (Well, either a site license, or an assload of Workstation licenses, I'm not really sure what the details are.)</p><p>I decided "Hey, why not play with the new release? You've got new hardware. Maybe VMware will run acceptably fast on it!"</p><p>Man, what a fucking brilliant idea that was.</p><p>Backstory: I haven't booted Windows in a few months, not since Doom3 came out and wasn't available initially on Linux. However, I have some shiny new devices in the new box, including a SATA DVD burner, which so far doesn't seem to work with Linux very well. Ubuntu's kernel enables SATA ATAPI support, which Jeff Garzik tells me is a bad naughty thing of them to do since it's not ready yet. Which results in my ability to *see* the drive on /dev/scd0, if the planets align properly, but I can't actually use it for much.</p><p>This machine doesn't have a floppy drive, since I'm a cheap bastard, and I happen to agree with Apple on this one. Fuck floppies. They should have died a long time ago. I also refuse to run Windows XP - I bought and paid for Windows 2000, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, and it's the last release of Windows that I really plan on ever using. Windows 2000, being rather old, has some deficiencies, however. Like not having SATA support in the installer (unless you load a driver from a floppy, which I don't have).</p><p>I think to myself, "Hey! VMware! Raw disk support! It used to work pretty well, why not try doing an installation from a virtual machine into a physical disk? You can use the VM to download drivers, then create a new hardware profile, reboot into it, and maybe that'll work."</p><p>HAHAHAHAA</p><p>Let's just say that this was probably the worst idea I've had all night, even worse than eating that third slice of pizza. My partition table on /dev/hda now looks like this, thanks to VMware:</p><p><pre>Disk /dev/hda: 41.1 GB, 41174138880 bytes<br />16 heads, 63 sectors/track, 79780 cylinders<br />Units = cylinders of 1008 * 512 = 516096 bytes</p><p>This doesn't look like a partition table<br />Probably you selected the wrong device.</p><p>   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System<br />/dev/hda1   ?      216399     1904881   850995205   72  Unknown<br />Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.<br />/dev/hda2   ?      723265     1262922   271987362   74  Unknown<br />Partition 2 does not end on cylinder boundary.<br />/dev/hda3   ?      167316      167316           0   65  Novell Netware 386<br />Partition 3 does not end on cylinder boundary.<br />/dev/hda4         2671568     2671619       25817+   0  Empty<br />Partition 4 does not end on cylinder boundary.</p><p>Partition table entries are not in disk order<br /></pre></p><p>I'm not even sure what to say about that.</p><p>(For those of you wondering why I wanted to play with Windows in the first place - SATA DVD burner. I know that I can install Win2K drivers for the SATA chipset, and I know that the DVD burner will *probably* work there.)<br /></p>

And the reason that it's annoying to me is because it's inconsistent. Some of the iterator methods are global and some of them are not. Inconsistency is lame. End of topic.</li> <li>Ternary operators seem to be quite the polarizing issue so I'll just leave my stance exactly where it is. I think they're useful, and I'd like to have them, but obviously I can work around the language not having them...</li> <li>Especially since Python doesn't have sane scoping, either; the method-local and class-local scoping rules provide the opportunity for <b>way</b> too many obscure and annoying bugs.

		<div class="text">
			<p>(This is a pretty geeky entry, so if you're not a geek, consider yourself warned.)<br />I have a lot of little tiny annoyances with python, since I've been using it for a while now to hack on some stuff. Here's a collection of the ones that are floating on top of my brain.</p><p><h4>::sniff::</h4><br />I miss my ternary operator.</p><p>In C, and C++, and Perl, and Ruby, and PHP, and pretty much any language that I've ever written in (hell, I think even JavaScript supports this, though I could be wrong about that one since I haven't written any JavaScript code in years), you can use a very terse syntax for <code>if (foo) { return bar; } else { return baz; }</code> using what is referred to as the ternary operator.</p><p>The shortened syntax is more like:<br /><pre><br />(foo ? bar : baz)<br /></pre></p><p>Yeah, it's kinda weird. And yeah, if you don't understand it, it's not very intuitive. However, it makes for much shorter and clearer code (to those who grok ternary operators). Python doesn't support this. At all. There was a proposal to include it and it got smacked down, so that they could include such other genius ideas as <code>reversed()</code> instead. Speaking of which...</p><p><h4>backwards</h4><br />Reversing an array is done like:<br /><pre><br />foo = ['one', 'two', 'three']<br />foo.reverse()<br /></pre><br />This does not return a reversed copy of the array, but it does reverse the array in-place and return 'None' which is quite confusing. Especially if you're used to sensible languages which return a reversed copy. So this code doesn't work.<br /><pre><br />foo = ['one', 'two', 'three']<br />for i in foo.reverse(): <span color="#29416C"># bzzzt, reverse() returns 'None'</span><br />	print i<br /></pre><br />You <b>can</b> iterate through an array with the <code>reversed()</code> keyword, like:<br /><pre><br />for i in reversed(foo):<br />	print i<br /></pre><br /><b>However</b>, this is a python-2.4-specific feature, so it's useless if you care about older python releases. Also, it doesn't create a reversed array, just hands you a pointer to a reversed list iterator. So you can't do:</p><p><pre><br />foo = ['one', 'two', 'three']<br />bar = reversed(foo)<br />print bar[0] <span color="#29416C"># 'three'? how about a TypeError!</span><br /></pre></p><p>Because <code>bar</code> is actually not a list, or array, or what-have-you, but it's a listreverseiterator object. Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean. What it translates into is basically "Surprise! We hate you."</p><p>So, you have to do:<br /><pre><br />foo = ['one', 'two', 'three']<br />foo.reverse()<br />for i in foo:<br />	print i<br /></pre><br />Which, granted, ok, isn't the end of the world, but it's pretty ugly and it doesn't work at <b>all</b> the way I had expected it to, which to me is the sign of a language that sucks.</p><p>For reference, the following code in ruby does work exactly how I expected it to. And because ruby and python share a decent amount of syntactical sugar, I keep on getting annoyed when things that I expect to be working in python simply aren't.<br /><pre><br />foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']<br />p foo.reverse() <span color="#29416c"># prints out "['c', 'b', 'a']"</span><br />foo.reverse().each { |i|<br />	print i<br />}<br /></pre><br />Ruby's list iterators are weird, sure. But actually, that's a good way to bring up my next complaint.</p><p><h4>iterators in general</h4><br />Why the hell do you have multiple types of list iterator methods in python? I shouldn't have to remember a different type of iterator method for every different type of container, nor should I have to remember whether it's a global iterator method or a per-container one. That's just annoying, and pointless.</p><p>So, you have <code>foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']</code>, right.<br />Now, to recap, you can traverse the list backwards (in 2.4, anyway) with:<br /><pre><br />for i in reversed(foo):<br />	print i<br /></pre></p><p>You can get the indexes of the members of the list with:<br /><pre><br />for i in xrange(foo):<br />	print i <span color="#29416C"># Prints out the index of each member</span><br /></pre></p><p>You can also do:<br /><pre><br />for i, n in enumerate(foo):<br />	print i, n <span color="#29416C"># Prints the index and the member</span><br /></pre><br />Although I have no idea why you'd want to. (You can always just do xrange(foo) and then 'foo[i]' since they give you the same thing. But ternary operators would be too confusing.)</p><p>But, if you have a dict instead of a list, all of a sudden...<br /><pre><br />foo = { 'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3 }<br />for i, n in foo.iteritems():<br />	print i, n<br /></pre></p><p>Using <code>enumerate()</code> gives you the index of the 'a', 'b', and 'c' keys. Also, note that <code>enumerate()</code> is a global, like <code>reversed()</code>, but <code>iteritems()</code> is a member of the dict class type. This is the kind of inconsistency in a language that kills me.</p><p><h4>white space</h4><br />Surprisingly, I don't mind the whitespace thing. It just doesn't bother me that much. (Ok, so that's not really a complaint. Still, enough other people complain that I figured it was worth noting that it just doesn't irk me.)</p><p><h4>scoping</h4><br />Scoping is <b>weird</b> in python. Let me explain.<br />In regular languages, a variable declared inside of a block of code only lives until the end of that block; this is the 'scope' of the variable. So if you have:<br /><pre><br />if (condition) {<br />	string foo = "hahahaha";<br />}<br />print (foo); <span color="#29416C">/* Error! 'foo' didn't make it past that last '}' */</span><br /></pre><br />(Yeah, that's not a real language, though I suppose it could be valid C or C++ or something. I don't care, it's just there to illustrate a point.)</p><p>But in python, guess what?</p><p><pre><br />if condition:<br />	foo = "hahahaha"</p><p>print foo <span color="#29416C"># This actually <b>*works*</b> - wtf?</span><br /></pre></p><p>There are other issues that annoy me, but these are just the ones on top of my head. I'll write another rant if this one pisses off enough python devs.<br /></p>

Don't get me wrong - it's pretty impressive.

			<p>I spent most of this week at LinuxWorld in Boston (and the very beginning of the week at the XDevConf, which ajax took notes of) so my legs are killing me. But last night, Google sponsored this amazingly kick-ass dinner for a few dozen of us free software hacker types, and it was completely badass.</p><p>They had some issues with their food distribution algorithms though. Hopefully next year, if they roll out Google Dinner 2.0, they'll have that algorithm sorted out. (It took an inordinate amount of time to get our food since everyone had to wait in a huge line to get served - there's definitely room for optimization there, I think.)</p><p>I talked Dave Jones into coming along and we had an awesome time. As soon as we walked in, we were accosted by Google folks who made us fill out some registration cards. One of the fields on the card said "Desired position" so I asked the woman (who had an amazingly kick-ass Google shirt, one with a female symbol on one of the 'o's in Google, but I digress) "What does this 'desired position' field mean?"</p><p>"We want to know, if you were to work for us, what position would you want to have?"</p><p>This stunned me. What an amazingly smart way of getting people interested. So davej and I filled in "spaceman" and "Batman" respectively. I mean, if Google is going to be hiring someone to be Batman, I certainly hope that they'd consider me for the position, because I think I could do really well in that role.</p><p>Got to meet some cool people there, including <a href="http://mako.yukidoke.org/copyrighteous/">Mako</a> who apparently wanted to meet me because he knew who I was. Finding out that other people <i>know who I am</i> and want to meet me.... that's kinda freaky. I mean, granted, we're not talking about Havoc Pennington-style rockstar status.</p><p>Yet.<br /></p>

			<p>I attempted to hunt down a copy of World of Warcraft a few weeks ago, in vain.</p><p>My searches were fruitless. I went to several Wal-Marts, Targets, and Gamestops. All were completely devoid of World of Warcraft loving. This made me sad.</p><p>I ended up going to go visit Tony (who I'll be dropping by to see again on the sixth for the Chinese New Year) and I crashed at his place after he, Rob, and I stayed up until way too late watching Battlestar Galactica at Rob's place. The following morning, we got up and I talked Tony into going to the Apple store. It wasn't that hard to convince him, actually. I just said "We're going to the Apple Store," and he complied. Once there, I had the instant flash of realization that the wonderful bastards at Blizzard put the Mac and PC versions of their games on the same CDs. Those crazy fools. I searched for the gem and - lo and behold - there were FIVE copies of WoW. I picked mine up, made sure it wasn't some book or gift card (like Target had. For shame, Target! For shame.) and I carried it to the line at the register and bought it.</p><p>The game is incredible. It's seriously just amazing. If only I had a decent video card, one that didn't overheat when I played it... And dealing with Windows is shitty.</p><p>Which is why I've bought a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">dedicated World of Warcraft box</a>. It hasn't arrived yet, which irks me. But it should be here "on or before" the seventeenth of February, according to Apple. Huzzah for that.</p><p>That's about all that's new in the past few weeks. I'll attempt to blog more frequently - hey, I should dump my .plan on here sometime and see what people think - but it'd probably be easier if I had my blogging app working again. Sounds like a fun project for tonight!<br /></p>

			<p>So mpyne had implemented a somewhat working SPC plugin for GStreamer which was pretty limited and somewhat useless.

I've since rewritten it (from scratch) as a filter and not a src. It works on my system, kind of. I haven't gotten the typefind implementation done yet, and it's pretty fragile at the moment - I haven't figured out exactly why, but somehow removing a printf from the spc_setup function causes the plugin to segfault (I think LoadSPCFile may be doing something strange, but I'm not sure...)</p><p>If you have tla installed, you can do:<br /><pre>tla register-archive http://c133.org/arch/<br />tla get clee@kde.org--2004/gst-spc--filter--0 gst-spc</pre></p><p>If you don't have tla, you can try poking around on the site but seeing as how things aren't quite ready for mass consumption, I'm not making any releases just yet.</p><p>Now, to go take a shower.

I couldn't even get the crap to compile, let alone to run and dump a bunch of zeroes like he was getting.</p><p>I had mpyne tar up his work and send it my way to see if I could find anything new. About forty-five minutes later, after we'd both looked in a lot of unrelated areas, I found the missing link: A call to ResetAPU. Added that in, and all of a sudden, it works!</p><p>Now, that wasn't enough. Since I finally have this library compiling, and running, I don't want to simply dump the first five seconds of every SPC to a wave file named output.wav. I want to play them to my speakers!</p><p>Having no prior experience with libao, but remembering somewhat vaguely that the API didn't look too disgusting, I decided to try to get SPC->libao output working. And now, just under an hour later, <a href="http://c133.org/tmp/spcplay.cpp">I have it working</a>. And I even cleaned up the code a little bit so it's not quite as embarrassing.</p><p>This code probably won't do most of you any good, but this is mostly for mpyne's benefit as I'm not convinced I'll still be conscious when he gets back. However, if you are interested in playing with it, you can <a href="http://c133.org/files/snesapu-linux.tar.bz2">grab the tarball</a> from my site.

			<p>The machine which was previously hosting c133.org (my domain) was compromised recently. So I set about finding new hosting, and I did thanks to Warren Togami (a coworker of mine at Red Hat) so you are now seeing c133.org on a brand-new box.</p><p>One interesting side effect of this is that my weblog is now statically generated instead of dynamically so.

So now my blog should be even faster.</p><p>Oh, and <a href="http://planetKDE.org/">planet KDE</a> has a new home as well. Thanks to Stephen Depooter, it's now on a separate machine from c133.org and very unscientific cursory testing shows to me that it's even more well-connected than it was before. So, despite the fact that the breakin shut down the sites, I think that they're both better off now. And my mail seems to have mostly caught up with itself. Which is good.</p><p>now that I've been forced to get off my ass and actually look over the files on the site, I've done a little tiny bit of maintenance and cleaned up a few things that were previously still around.

And my workstation at home is set up in a rather decidedly non-ergonomic fashion, which means that I can't really use the computer for extended periods of time without standing up and stretching out my knees.</p><p>I do have plans for stuff to hack on and plenty of things to keep me busy though. So don't worry about that, guys.

			<p>mpyne has called me out and made it public that I have Grand Plans for a pyblosxom plugin which will read (via XML-RPC) a chunk of text and then throw it on the blog if it likes it.</p><p>The trick is getting the plugin to like it.</p><p>My idea currently is to make the chunk of text a valid GPG-signed message. Have the server plugin read it in, decode it, check the signature against the configured key ID from the pyblosxom config file, and then if all of the criteria match, post it on the blog.</p><p>Have a few small issues to work out, but it looks like a lot of the hard work has been done for me. daniels wrote a Perl script that sort of does this if you filter email into it, but I hate Perl and the setup for that is annoying. Editing pyblosxom's config files is easy; I doubt that I'm going to end up losing data that way. If I somehow misconfigure a mail server, such that everything for my email ends up at blog@c133.org or something, I'll be fucked.</p><p>And I don't like that. So, I guess this is the part where I formally announce that I have intentions to actually finish this module (since I have a half-aborted attempt at it from a while back), clean up the code so that my key ID and stuff are no longer hardcoded into it, and then there might actually be a public release.</p><p>(Of course, once it's out, a KDE app which will be able to post to it, probably by using DCOP to communicate with KGPG, will be forthcoming.)<br /></p>

Hopefully other KDE developers will read these notes and at least take them into consideration when discussing our eventual move away from CVS.</p><p>So - first off, a few words about CVS. CVS has served KDE faithfully for years, and has been (for us) fairly stable and reliable. It doesn't change much. And, believe it or not, CVS does have some strengths. <br /><table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3"><tr><th colspan="2">CVS</th></tr><tr><th>Strengths</th><th>Weaknesses</th></tr><tr><td><ul><li>Ubiquitous (practically every operating system on every platform can run CVS)</li><li>Relatively light on resource usage</li><li>Comparitively light on disk usage</li><li>It actually <b>works</b></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Branching is painful</li><li>Lacking in certain very basic features</li><li>Lack of atomicity with commits; no transactions</li><li>Not very well-optimized for low-bandwidth</li><li>Difficulty handling binary files properly</li></ul></td></tr></table></p><p>Now, Subversion fixes a few of these issues, but at the core Subversion's goal is to be a better CVS than CVS. It doesn't implement wire compatibility, nor can it natively use the old CVS repository format; instead, it maintains the same ideas as CVS (namely the same centralized development model), as well as a compatible command-set except for areas where changes are needed to deal with Subversion having features that CVS doesn't.<br /><table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3"><tr><th colspan="2">Subversion</th></tr><tr><th>Strengths</th><th>Weaknesses</th></tr><tr><td><ul><li>Little to no learning curve if you already know CVS</li><li>Atomic commits, with <a title="If the commit fails - client kills it, connection dies, etc - it doesn't end up halfway in the repository.

We have a very centralized development model; however, the disk usage issue is depressing to think about. I ran a test conversion of our kdelibs repository from CVS to Subversion, once using the Berkeley database backend and once using the new fsfs backend; the bdb backend takes up 1194M of space, and the fsfs backend takes 1130M of space on my system. In comparison, the CVS repository takes up 281M of space for the same revisions. Some of the Subversion developers have offered me a few hints, but I cringe to think about how difficult the migration will be for a <b>large</b> module such as kde-i18n.<br /></p>

			<p>So there's some pretty <a href="http://lists.kde.org/?t=109726039700003&r=1&w=2">heavy discussion</a> on the kde-core-devel list about migrating from CVS to Subversion for the entire KDE project.</p><p>All I can say is, the sooner, the better.</p><p>Of course, I'm very much of the mind that tla &gt; svn &gt; cvs, but as long as we're moving up the stack, even if marginally, it's still progress. Plus, svn has the feature that it is much more like tla than CVS is, and the cvs2svn guys have already written an impressive script to convert the ancient RCS files into changesets. And since both Subversion and Arch are changeset-oriented... I'm very excited. In my mind at least, it shouldn't be too insanely difficult to migrate from svn to tla in the future...<br /></p>

			<p>My evil plot to subvert GNOME is slowly taking shape. Todd Berman is talking about having me help him with some C# bindings for libgaim.

Want to set up Ubuntu on one of my machines here since it seems to be pretty cool and I'm all about Debian without the brain damage.

			<p>I've been looking at a few laptops lately. Apparently the model I've been ogling - the hp nx7010 - is very much similar to the Compaq X1000 (which shouldn't be a surprise to anyone). I have decided that the specs that I want are:<br /><ol><li>Centrino. Pentium M or bust, I say. (It's the only way I'm likely to get any decent battery life out of a laptop these days.</li><li>Wide-screen 8:5 aspect ratio. I suspect that 1280x800 may be too small; 1440x900 seems about right, but I will probably love 1680x1050 as well, but the important thing is that it's wide-screen.</li><li>I would really prefer it without an OS but the other two specs have so far made this look extremely unlikely, as the only manufacturers I've seen happen to be stuck with nasty evil agreements with Microsoft. (see previous rant.)</li><li>Oh, also. I need at least half a gig of RAM, a 40 gig hard drive, a mobility Radeon would be nice (since it seems like the mobile GeForce chips aren't that prevalent in the Centrino machines...), a DVD/CDRW combo drive, Firewire, and gigabit ethernet.</li></ol><br />Yeah, it sounds like what I want is basically a Powerbook, I know. Except that since I'm going to be working at redhat, I get the feeling that an Apple laptop would be sort of ... bad karma.</p><p>We'll see what happens.<br /></p>

(As an aside, I also took out all of the Asteroid-specific code and put it into a Skeleton style, which is BSD-licensed and available on my site).</p><p>However, being that I'm lazy and Asteroid got Good Enough TM for me to use without being too annoyed with it, Asteroid was put on hold at version 0.2. Until today, that is. I got an email from David Chester, with the Munjoy Linux distribution, and he has implemented much more of the widget style code, and submitted his changes back to me. (As an aside, Munjoy looks quite nifty, and I'm going to have to try it out. KDE + Debian = Righteous.)</p><p>So, yeah. I started something neat, and somebody else picked it up and ran with it.

It's a pain in the arse, especially for cross-browser compatibility, and I'm itching to try out a few other look'n'feel combinations. DanielS has suggested that I should try to become a DD.

I got to meet a bunch of cool guys and I had a blast chatting with them, about all sorts of stuff. they had me show up at 10AM and I was supposed to be done by 3, but they kept me until a little after 4. which hopefully is a good sign, but I don't want to get my hopes _too_ far up.</p><p>the hospital was basically a dead end, though. they don't have any positions for the IS department, but they swore that they would call me as soon as they do. they did seem to be pretty impressed though, so I think it went well even if nothing comes of it. it's experience, anyway. which is always good.<br /></p>

			<p>so now that I have a local kerberos server, and it hands out tickets like a champ, and life is good, the next (logical) step is to want to have single-sign-on for things like (say) my email.</p><p>KDE has a custom ground-up SASL implementation that supports LOGIN, PLAIN, CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5, but not GSSAPI (which is a layer on top of Kerberos). I took a look at it and decided that I could implement a GSSAPI function for the KDE SASL implementation. I had no idea that it'd be so damned frustrating. why is GSSAPI so complicated, and poorly-designed to boot?</p><p>if you think I'm joking, or complaining about nothing - the main function, gss_init_sec_context, takes THIRTEEN parameters. that's a lot of margin-for-error. one would think they might use custom data structures, ones more complicated than the standard struct with a void pointer and an int to indicate the length of the data, but no. of course not.</p><p>oh well. when I'm done, KDE will have a GSSAPI implementation, meaning that it should Just Work (TM) with any Kerberized service that uses SASL. Namely, this means IMAP servers and probably a few SMTP servers - having single-sign-on for these services will be great.<br /></p>

			<p>so I finished setting up a working LDAP server here at home. with Kerberos, for that single-sign-on goodness. I can see why people dig this. I can also see why people fucking hate it. awesome features, complete and total pain in the ass to set up. honestly, I think I probably would rather have installed openBSD, and that's saying a lot.</p><p>but now that it's working, and I have it set up, I am a golden god.<br /></p>

			<p>I got an email from a Linux distributor today asking me if I would mind going into some detail on my widget style experience.

			<p>So I got a 200G hard drive today. My dad decided to buy it for me as payment for all of the work I've been doing trying to get his printer working exactly the way he wants it.</p><p>Mmmmm. New hardware. I've completed the move of my /home over to the new drive, and now it's just a matter of wiping the 20G drive with my operating systems on it and using the 40G drive that previously held /home as my new OS drive. (I can fit more operating systems in 40G than I can in 20G! WOOOHOOO!)</p><p>Also, having the laser printer connected to the Mac works seamlessly with KDE over the network. I just pointed a KDE app at the Mac's IP, and it automatically grokked the print queue and even showed me both printers that have been connected to the Mac - nifty stuff. I love open source software.</p><p>(still have to make progress on some sort of a KDE-pyblosxom client. moving that to the top of the TODO, once I'm done screwing with the hard drives.)<br /></p>
