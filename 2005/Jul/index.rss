    <description>&lt;p&gt;Stroking is hard. So hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I hear the word &apos;stroke&apos; from now on, I&apos;m going to hear keithp purr. That disturbs me to no end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other news, the DDC at OLS has been a lot of fun. I&apos;m going to have to disagree with chouimat about a few things - namely, I think that Xgl is extremely sexy, and has a hell of a future, and while it&apos;s true that the vast majority of the talks here are GNOME-related or have a GNOME bias... it&apos;s because we are vastly outnumbered on this side of the pond, and you can count the number of KDE developers at this conference on one hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Staikos was here for a couple of hours, I&apos;ve been here for the DDC but not OLS, chouimat was here (but let&apos;s face it, you haven&apos;t been active in KDE lately, chouimat, and neither have I), and Alexander Dymo is here and gave a talk about KDevelop. We&apos;re not exactly taking over here. We need more of a presence at these shows, people. It&apos;s important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I may be abusing my &apos;tech/KDE&apos; category with this entry, but so be it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.more-cowbell.org/&quot;&gt;new tagging application called &apos;cowbell&apos;&lt;/a&gt; is out and it looks pretty boring. Reading through it I was mostly uninterested until I hit this part:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It requires the Mono runtime, Gtk#, and TagLib to install and run.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holy crap! GTK/GNOME apps using evil KDE technology! THE SKIES THEY ARE FALLING I TELL YOU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, good on them. &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html&quot;&gt;TagLib&lt;/a&gt; is good stuff, and I&apos;m glad to see that they&apos;re not reinventing the wheel. More projects need to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Some asshole thought it would be a good idea to string up yellow &quot;CAUTION&quot; tape and block one of the one-way roads leading to my apartment building inside of the complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not amused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stopped my car, pulled up the handbrake, flipped on the emergency lights, got out, and walked to one side of the tape. I ripped it off, and some guy screamed out &quot;HEY!!!&quot; I turned to his general direction and flipped him off, and walked across the street to the other side, where I pulled down the rest of the tape and tossed it into my car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Got back into my car and parked in my parking lot without incident, throwing out the tape on my way in to my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God dammit, I hate people sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
