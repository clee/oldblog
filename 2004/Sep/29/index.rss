    <description>&lt;p&gt;I dropped tberman off at the Westford Regency Inn and on the way home, I took exit #35B from the 495. That particular exit is a little bit sharp. I was going about thirty and I probably should have been going about twenty, and my car started to slide as it hydroplaned. Amazingly enough, I managed to control the slide and even though I did pull a *sweet* 180, I didn&apos;t even scratch the car. Nor did I get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for all you folks out there rooting for my death, I have cheated you once again. Bitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
