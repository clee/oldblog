    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/1465&quot;&gt;Fab&lt;/a&gt;: NetworkManager actually has a pretty well-designed separation between the front-end and the back-end; the only problem stalling us from being able to do cool things with it right now is that we have no working DBUS bindings for KDE3 (so nobody can easily write a Kicker applet to interface with NetworkManager to use on their desktop &lt;b&gt;today&lt;/b&gt;), and KDE4 doesn&apos;t actually have anything usable at this point, whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brought this up at aKademy - aseigo and I were basically ready to go ahead with it but we got sidetracked with window icon previews in the window list on the desktop pager hover tooltip. (Try saying that five times fast.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, somebody could write the applet using the DBUS API from C, but the current Qt bindings in the DBUS tree are pretty much worthless, so it&apos;s not going to be pretty either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
