    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m finally in New York, and I&apos;ve actually been here for a couple of weeks now. been a while since I updated the blog so I figured &quot;what the hell&quot; and decided to go ahead and post a bit of info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the job search hasn&apos;t been too promising so far, but Syracuse is gorgeous. I really love the area, and the fact that snow is all over the place probably has something to do with it. everyone here thinks I&apos;m insane because I love the cold; maybe I am actually crazy, but I still get a kick out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;haven&apos;t had much time to hack on KDE lately, what with trying to find viable employment. my aunt has this great idea that I should be the Easter Bunny or one of his assistants; I&apos;m really not too into the idea personally, but I do have to admit that it&apos;d probably be pretty funny if I had to resort to that. I mean, it&apos;d suck terribly for me of course. but it&apos;d still be hilarious, and maybe in a few years I&apos;d be able to laugh about it. maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
