    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been playing with ATA over Ethernet on my home network and I have to say, it is pretty damn sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it would be absolutely perfect if I could use AOE to share drives to my media center, and then use ZFS on that machine. Unfortunately, Linux doesn&apos;t have ZFS, and OpenSolaris doesn&apos;t seem to have AOE yet. (The Coraid site has a Solaris driver, and they claim it works on Solaris 7+, but there is no source and I don&apos;t happen to have an OpenSolaris machine to test it on at the moment.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But - the ability to pool together all of my disparate disks into one gigantic volume is awesome. It&apos;s like Voltron, but with hard drives instead of robots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
