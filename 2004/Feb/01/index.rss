    <description>&lt;p&gt;everybody else is blogging about it, so I guess I&apos;ll join in too. orkut is nifty. I don&apos;t have five thousand friends, but I think that maybe instead of being obsessed with collecting as many as possible I&apos;m going to just use it to keep in touch with the ones that I do have. well, the ones that are on the service anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;other than that, not much news. been listening to Massive Attack&apos;s 100th Window lately. good stuff. really starting to dig Thirteenth Step, as well, for some reason. I didn&apos;t like it that much when I first heard it, but it&apos;s grown on me quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
