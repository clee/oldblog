    <description>&lt;p&gt;I blogged last month about switching my phone to Vonage, which has gone swimmingly well. I&apos;m really happy with Vonage, in that I haven&apos;t had to deal with them at all because their product just works (which is so rare in our industry that it&apos;s scary, and I&apos;m sad that I even find it noticeable that I&apos;m commenting on it), and also in that the features they provide seem to work really well. Being able to check my voicemail from the web is totally badass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, since I no longer have a cell phone to keep my address book on, I decided to pick up a Palm once more. After checking out a few models and consulting with coworkers, I decided to pick up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.palm.com/us/products/handhelds/tungsten-e2/&quot;&gt;Tungsten E2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put my order in on Tuesday, December 6th, and I made sure to select &apos;Overnight shipping&apos; because I&apos;m an impatient bastard and I want it &lt;b&gt;now&lt;/b&gt;. I would&apos;ve gone into a store to buy it, but it came with a free 128MB MMC flash card when I bought it online from Palm, and like a sucker, I decided to go for the freebie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I also noticed, just after submitting my order, that Amazon was selling the same exact handheld, sans the 128MB flash card, for $150. D&apos;oh.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just got a mail from Palm, &lt;b&gt;today&lt;/b&gt;, informing me that my order has been shipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&apos;t have it until Monday; even if UPS does deliver it tomorrow, I had it scheduled for an office delivery since I expected to be at work, and I&apos;m not planning on going in to the office tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, by the time I get it, it will have been almost a week since I placed the order. With &quot;Overnight&quot; shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
