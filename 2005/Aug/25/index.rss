    <description>&lt;p&gt;Spain is pretty damned cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, ok, more accurately, Spanish women are pretty damned cool. I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ve seen more cleavage since I landed in Madrid than I have since I moved to Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip has been exciting so far. There were two legs on the flight over - the stopover in Frankfurt was pretty uneventful. I was surprised by the fact that Lufthansa provided metal utensils for the in-flight meals; it impressed me, but at the same time, I had a realization. I shouldn&apos;t be impressed by metal silverware; I should be disappointed by plastic silverware. And on the flight from Frankfurt to Madrid, I was depressed - I guess the metal silverware is only for the cross-Atlantic flights. Anyway, once I landed, I wasn&apos;t too worried about navigating the Frankfurt airport; I&apos;ve been there before (the last time I came to a KDE conference, actually) and in general, I find airports to be reasonably simple to navigate, even if you don&apos;t speak the language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airport in Madrid was also pretty easy; figuring out how to get on the metro was not too hard, but it took a bit more walking than I expected it would. Once I was on the subway, I figured out pretty quickly that &apos;proxima&apos; is Spanish for &apos;next&apos; and I was set. The route that I had planned out actually worked exactly as I hoped it would. I got off the metro at the right stop for the train station and almost bought a ticket for the right train on the wrong day. Once I made it to the train, I figured I was pretty close to safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The train arrived exactly when expected, and there were lots of taxis outside of the train station waiting for us, which was good. The taxi driver I rode with didn&apos;t speak much English and had no idea where the place I wanted to go happened to be; he got directions from the central office, though, and somehow I managed to find the student residence where most of us are staying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s the last of this entry - there&apos;s more to follow, I promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
