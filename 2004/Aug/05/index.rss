    <description>&lt;p&gt;Sat down with Ed and Zack yesterday and basically did a mind-meld; we had an hour-plus-long braindump session where I let loose all of the ideas, concerns, and issues that I&apos;ve been thinking about as far as desktop QA goes here at Red Hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Flanagan dropped in towards the end of it, and he seems to be quite open to a lot of our ideas, which is awesome. Hopefully we can get the budget/machines allocated to implement the desktop testing lab that we want to set up; that would be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number of times I&apos;ve forgotten my cardkey at the new office: Two&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number of days since someone has passed out in the bathroom: Nine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Talked to Scott James Remnant today, and asked him about the bug with atom.xml parsing and &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; elements; he pointed me at his arch tree and told me to update from there, which I&apos;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net effect, a tiny bump and all of a sudden atom.xml feeds are looking dead sexy. Anybody who&apos;s currently blogging on blogspot - your feeds should no longer look like crap! There was a small bug for a minute with the old template, where the (feed) links in the sidebar on the right were all pointing back to planetKDE.org instead of pointing to the actual RSS feed from the developer. That&apos;s been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice any other issues, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:clee@kde.org&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
