    <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel and I drove up with Chris Blizzard for OLS, and we&apos;ve been here since Sunday. The conference is kicking *major* ass, and I&apos;ve gotten to meet tons of awesome people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bourbon that Bdale and Keith picked up completely knocked me on my ass though. I was completely out of commission on Tuesday, and barely managed to recover for Wednesday&apos;s activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada. What more can I really say? Like home, but just different enough to fuck with me. It&apos;s cool here, though; the wifi from the balcony is sort of spotty, but otherwise the room is awesome. More alcohol than I thought could be consumed has been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to convince Steph to start blogging. No luck as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel is cramming hard for some deadlines. Which sucks for him. I feel kind of weird, being alone out here on the balcony, knowing that everyone else is asleep already. Good time to blog, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind of missing home, oddly enough. Never been homesick like this, not since the parents moved me to Arizona. Also, my mind keeps wandering back to Libby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;::sigh::&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, though - surprising quantities of ass-kickery have shown up in my life lately, and I&apos;m still frankly quite shocked at it. If only life could be this badass all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
