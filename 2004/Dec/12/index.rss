    <description>&lt;p&gt;My addiction to caffeine may actually be completely over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I succumbed to the desire to have a can of Coke on Friday night but the really strange thing is that it didn&apos;t even really taste good. And I haven&apos;t had any headaches all day so I don&apos;t think that I&apos;m actually caffeine-dependent anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m still not sure whether or not I should count this against my Operation Zero Caffeine initiative. I didn&apos;t even finish the whole can, sadly. (And I think we all know how much I hate wasting things.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I did crumble, and then found the soda to be less than I had remembered it. Somehow, it just wasn&apos;t the same. I feel... disenfranchised, I think. Maybe a little disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh well. At least the headaches are still gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
