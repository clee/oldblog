    <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got to meet a few people I hadn&apos;t met before, including aseigo. He&apos;s taller than I expected, at least. According to him, I don&apos;t look anything like what he thought I&apos;d look like, but I sound &lt;b&gt;exactly&lt;/b&gt; the way he thought I would. Along with Thomas Zander and Rainer Endres (and someone else whose name I can&apos;t remember) we left at around 1AM to go find a bar. We asked a couple of locals where a good place to get a drink would be, and they gave us some directions and told us to look for the &apos;Marabu&apos; or something similar. After about thirty seconds of walking, aseigo was already calling it the &apos;caribou&apos; and I had to correct him. Once we arrived in the area that they said it would be at, there was a building with with a bright neon pink heart sign that said &apos;Marib&amp;eacute;.&apos;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, before entering, we had a couple of theories. One that we figured was likely was that the locals had sent us to a gay bar, which would have amused us. Rainer didn&apos;t want to go in, but I ventured in with aseigo and Thomas and the kid whose name I can&apos;t remember; I saw a bar with alcohol behind it and a bartender, so I went back to the door and motioned to Rainer that it was ok, it was just a bar, and everything looked fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rainer took a step in and then decided that he was going to go to the restaurant next door instead; I hadn&apos;t eaten or had anything to drink since much earlier, so I decided to join Rainer instead of staying with the other guys. Rainer ordered a beer, and I got a soda. About fifteen minutes later, aseigo and crew came out to join us and they were laughing pretty hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the Marib&amp;eacute; is actually a brothel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that even funnier than finding that out (which was pretty funny) was the fact that aseigo even &lt;b&gt;saw&lt;/b&gt; the sign by the stairs that said &apos;Services&apos; with a man and a woman on it, and he didn&apos;t get it until the woman told him that the price was 20 EUR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: It&apos;s worth noting that the Marabu was actually right next door to the restaurant that Rainer and I decided to go to; aseigo just couldn&apos;t resist the pink neon heart sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
