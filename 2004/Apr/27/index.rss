    <description>&lt;p&gt;Have to go apartment hunting today. (I&apos;m in Boston for the week, looking at the area and seeing what&apos;s around here.) Basically, it looks like I&apos;m going to get face-raped by someone with a running start. A grand a month for a one-bedroom... it makes me want to cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh well. This is a good problem to have. Much better than the &quot;homeless, jobless, and starving&quot; problem I was facing a few months ago. Although if I can&apos;t find a place for a low-enough price, I may be facing that problem again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bright side of things, the X Developers Conference starts tomorrow and that should be a blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
