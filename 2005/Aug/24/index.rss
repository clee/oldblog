    <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is going to be &lt;b&gt;interesting&lt;/b&gt;, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m landing in an airport I&apos;ve never been to, in a country where I don&apos;t speak the native language, and I have to make it from the airport to the train station (which is not attached to the airport, but is at least two subway stops away). Once the train arrives at the destination, I still have to make it from the train station to the place I&apos;m actually staying, which is of course not exactly close by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I&apos;ll be in Spain and my phone won&apos;t work there, the best way to contact me is either IM or email; I won&apos;t be getting any voicemails until September 3 at the earliest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
