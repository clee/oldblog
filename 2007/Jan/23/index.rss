    <description>&lt;p&gt;Can&apos;t really think of anything funny or clever to say about this; I had surgery for my hernia today, and it went well, I suppose. I survived, and now I have a surprisingly large incision which has been covered in superglue. It&apos;s going to form a bad-ass scar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My surgeon prescribed vicodin and ibuprofen. I&apos;m not entirely sure that either of those is helping me at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was told before I went under the knife that the vicodin they were giving me was basically diazepam, which made me think of Metal Gear Solid, and I was happy. Visions of long, drawn-out boss fights with Sniper Wolf danced through my head. Unfortunately, it turns out that the nurse lied to me, and vicodin is not in fact diazepam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I had my prescriptions filled at Target, because of their totally sweet ClearRx bottles. If you haven&apos;t heard of them, you should &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/nymetro/health/features/11700/&quot;&gt;check out the story&lt;/a&gt; about why they&apos;re awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I&apos;m alive, and that&apos;s something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
