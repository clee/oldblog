    <description>&lt;p&gt;No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;No no no. Thank &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s subject is somewhat related to this entry though; I got a phone call this morning from my friend Randelle, who I haven&apos;t heard from in months. She&apos;s in the Army, stationed over in Germany at the moment. She isn&apos;t a big fan, apparently. We talked for a while - I was amazed. I shudder to think what the phone bill will be like for her friend, who had lent Randelle her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other new things... I saw Blade: Trinity last night. I liked it. I was a fan of the first two movies, though, and I love comics, so you probably shouldn&apos;t allow my opinion to sway you unless you also liked both other movies. If you did, this is more of the same - not much new, aside from Ryan Reynolds making lots of jokes about mostly stupid shit. (Right up my alley, of course, so I loved it. As did Steph. She is a huge Ryan Reynolds fan, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steph was pissed that I withheld the name of the actress who played the lead vampire bitch in the movie though. I honestly couldn&apos;t remember her last name. Steph couldn&apos;t remember anything except that her name started with a &apos;P&apos; - I got &apos;Parker&apos; stuck in my head for some reason but the &apos;Posey&apos; just didn&apos;t click.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I mentioned this to Steph and was immediately met with the Silent Treatment for being such a dick. Good times. (I wasn&apos;t intentionally being a dick, but oh well. Such is life.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Must convince more people to learn Esperanto. I&apos;m getting tired of speaking English. (And I could have sworn I caught some Esperanto in the movie, but I may just be hearing things.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
