    <description>&lt;p&gt;Picked up a new toy yesterday, a Logitech USB 200 headset. Hooray for USB audio! I&apos;m amazed at how nice it is. I&apos;m not an audiophile by any means, but this headset is a lot better than I was expecting. And it works great under Linux, as well as OS X. I hear it even works nicely under Windows...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this stuff. Had fun trying to get everything to play to the headphones, but it wasn&apos;t too difficult. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
