    <description>&lt;p&gt;Changed the oil on my car this morning. Heading up to Boston today to go look for an apartment/housing, as well as to go to the X Developers Conference - hooray!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something about doing an oil change is satisfying. I don&apos;t know exactly what it is, though. Just feels good. I&apos;m also glad to note that my car appears to not be burning oil, which may have something to do with my satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I got hired by Red Hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
