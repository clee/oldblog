    <description>&lt;p&gt;(responding to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chipx86.com/blog/archives/000100.html&quot;&gt;ChipX86&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;Dude. One word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, to be slightly less cryptic: Wireless devices won&apos;t ever really replace their wired counterparts until they no longer require battery replacement to run. Batteries that recharge by gyroscopic motion? Ok, cool. Batteries that recharge by quantum phase induction? Hey, even if I just made it up, it sounds cool, and as long as it means that I don&apos;t have to put new batteries in when the current ones die, I&apos;m all over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason I don&apos;t have any wireless peripherals right now is the battery issue. I&apos;ve almost talked myself into getting one of the Logitech mice that recharges on the base station - that&apos;s pretty close to my ideal scenario. It takes the whole &quot;there&apos;s a battery inside&quot; detail and makes it completely irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
