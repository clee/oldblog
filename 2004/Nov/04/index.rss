    <title>hackfest</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So geiseri hosted a hackfest at his place in PA last weekend. I showed up and brought manyoso with me; Nadeem Hasan came down, as did Mirko Boehm. Zack Rusin was already there, and it was fairly awesome. My only regret is that, despite the awesome time I had, I didn&apos;t get any hacking done since I don&apos;t have a laptop anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somebody broke into my car a couple of weeks ago. Shattered the quarter glass behind the passenger window, and stole my IBM Thinkpad T41 out of the back seat. (Well, the footspace behind the passenger seat. Close enough.) I have no idea where the laptop is, and, while the police have been informed, they haven&apos;t really proven to be that useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;End result: I have no laptop. So I was fairly useless at the hackfest as far as actual hacking goes. And my workstation at home is set up in a rather decidedly non-ergonomic fashion, which means that I can&apos;t really use the computer for extended periods of time without standing up and stretching out my knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do have plans for stuff to hack on and plenty of things to keep me busy though. So don&apos;t worry about that, guys. Just need my replacement laptop to come in from work, and maybe I can pick up a computer desk with my next paycheck somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realized that I haven&apos;t blogged in a while, so these entries are a bit longer than the usual length. I doubt anybody will really care that much, but yeah. Maybe I can kick myself into blogging more frequently once I get some Tack hacking done again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;and I never thought I&apos;d say that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things with Cassie are as complicated as ever. Still trying to figure out the whole situation; she has officially given me the &quot;Just Friends&quot; label, but I keep getting this vibe that she wouldn&apos;t mind being more at some point. Maybe it&apos;s just hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lon tried talking me into buying a motorcycle at one point in the past couple weeks. Blizzard also recommended it, as he&apos;s the proud owner of a new bike. I suggested the idea to Steph, who promptly called me an idiot and threatened to not be my friend anymore. I&apos;m still surprised by the things that anger her. She doesn&apos;t seem to have a valid reason for it, and when I probed for more details she pretended like she had already brought up the &quot;But you&apos;ll kill yourself!&quot; argument (which she hadn&apos;t).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cliff&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cliff.biffle.org/mongoose/&quot; title=&quot;I WANNA BE A MONGOOSE!&quot;&gt;new language&lt;/a&gt; is shaping up to be interesting. I never really dug the Smalltalk syntax (from what I saw of it) but I do like ObjC and Ruby is my preferred scripting language these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tia came to visit, and she kicks ass. It was awesome while she was here; it sucks now that she&apos;s gone, because I have nobody to cuddle with. Steph has a boyfriend, and even when she doesn&apos;t, she doesn&apos;t like cuddling with &lt;b&gt;me&lt;/b&gt; so that&apos;s out. Oh well - it was awesome while it lasted. Hopefully Tia&apos;ll be back up soon. And more of my friends will come out to visit me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
