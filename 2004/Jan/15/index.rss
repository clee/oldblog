    <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, you don&apos;t have to of course. But if you like me, or you really really like me, or you like the work I do on KDE or you just have too much money, you can donate funds to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=clee%40kde.org&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=USD&quot;&gt;clee@kde.org via PayPal&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ll be putting a button up as well. hooray capitalism!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I got an email from a Linux distributor today asking me if I would mind going into some detail on my widget style experience. Hopefully my reply will make a good impression, since I&apos;ve done a pretty decent amount of work in this field; I think it&apos;d rock if I were hired as a consultant or contracted out to for development work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life can be funny. I never expected that my after-school hobby might eventually open up so many doors for me. It&apos;s not quite the same as being a rock star, but life could definitely be much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
