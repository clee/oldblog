    <description>&lt;p&gt;ok, I have a problem. I have a problem with women, specifically. I won&apos;t name any names but I know you&apos;re reading this out there, and this entry is all because of YOU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;with that said, what the hell? I move to NY and all of a sudden, it&apos;s like &quot;Hey, you know... It&apos;s really too bad that you&apos;re in NY. And it&apos;s too bad that I have a boyfriend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;as if that&apos;s not bad enough, then it becomes &quot;Oh... well, I guess since you&apos;re in NY I can tell you that I did like you. hahaha! Doesn&apos;t that suck? You&apos;re 2500 miles away! And you can&apos;t do anything about it! But I do have a boyfriend anyway. Still...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;so. completely. uncool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m going to be beating myself over this for weeks. I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;maybe Josh has the right idea. although apparently, the same sort of thing happened to him after he went gay - only it became &quot;Hey, you know... It&apos;s really too bad that you&apos;re gay. I really liked you.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, seriously. I&apos;m not gay, and I don&apos;t think I ever could be, but you women are all evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
