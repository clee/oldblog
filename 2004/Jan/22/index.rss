    <description>&lt;p&gt;it&apos;s been almost a week since my last blog! damn. I resolved to make sure to update this more often. not even four weeks and I&apos;m already falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;yesterday was fun. Caitie, Nuge, Brandi, Josh, and I all went to Red Sea. Kevin was over there (surprise surprise!) and Cliff showed up eventually, as did Steph, It was like a party or something, almost. everybody&apos;s decided that they&apos;re going to throw me a huge going-away party, although the little details (like &quot;when&quot; and &quot;where&quot;) have yet to be decided. sounds like good fun though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steph took advantage of Brandi being there, and apologized to her. Or so she says. haven&apos;t heard Brandi&apos;s side of the story yet. still, it&apos;s nice to hear that Steph&apos;s trying to be less caustic. she got me a gift yesterday, too, completely unexpectedly. the Onion calendar. hooray! new Onion every day for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;that&apos;s about all. the last week hasn&apos;t been that interesting. tonight should be, though. Caitie and Nuge and I have finally agreed to do our intervention with Jessica. no idea how that&apos;s going to go, but ... it needs to be done. Jessica is a really great friend, and an amazing woman, and she deserves far better than what she&apos;s currently getting. anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
