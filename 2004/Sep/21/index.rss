    <description>&lt;p&gt;Steph got me sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a runny nose and a little tiny wussy cough when she came up this weekend but it hit me quite a bit harder last night. This morning doesn&apos;t feel quite so bad - my throat is still a little sore, and my sinuses are a little clogged up, but my nose is mostly not running now. Which is definitely an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even my tattoo can&apos;t make up for the inherent unsexiness of coughing my brains out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still evaluating whether or not Cassie will be safe from infection if I go to see her today. Should probably find a doctor... I have health benefits for a reason, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
