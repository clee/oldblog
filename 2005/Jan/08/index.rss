    <description>&lt;p&gt;So on Thursday, I get a phone call around five in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s my mom. I flip a coin and decide &quot;WTF, might as well answer it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says, &quot;I&apos;m at the airport. You should come pick me up.&quot; I respond with, &quot;Haha, mom. Very funny, but that&apos;d be &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; line, remember?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Backstory: Around Christmas, I was on the phone with the family and I tell my mom this plan that I&apos;ve been cooking for a few weeks, which was basically that I was going to neglect to inform anyone in advance of my plans to come visit. Meaning that, once I did show up, I&apos;d be totally unexpected and unannounced. It&apos;s more fun that way. I explained that the only notice that she&apos;d have would be my phone call from the airport, saying, &quot;Hey, you should come pick me up or something.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, my mom and I think more alike than even I want to admit. She had already bought her ticket to come up here by the time that we had this conversation around the holidays. She&apos;s here now, sitting on the sofa near me, rocking out to Bon Jovi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there&apos;s food in the fridge again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damn, I love having my mommy around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
