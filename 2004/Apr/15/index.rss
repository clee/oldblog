    <description>&lt;p&gt;I love MacOS X. I don&apos;t mince words about it; the UI is gorgeous, simple, to-the-point, and I love it. I love Linux as well, but mainly because it&apos;s usually a challenge to get working right. After getting particularly bored the other day, and I thought to myself &quot;You know, self, this iMac works entirely too well.&quot; Seven hours later, Gentoo is up and (mostly) running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major props out to the guys who wrote parted, the guy who wrote the patches to parted to let it resize HFS+ filesystems without destroying data (if I ever meet you, I owe you a beer), and whoever wrote the driver for reading HFS+ volumes under Linux. All of this stuff makes using Linux on a Mac a much more pleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in OS X land, though, the guys who I&apos;m the most impressed with are the team behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://colloquy.info/&quot;&gt;Colloquy&lt;/a&gt; which is hands-down, the single coolest Open Source application I&apos;ve seen on OS X yet. I&apos;ve seen a few other apps that I consider to have great user interfaces, but Colloquy is the only Open Source one. These guys are seriously awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m on IRC the other day and my pal Daniel asks me if I&apos;d be interested in taking care of a sysadmin task for him on the freedesktop.org box (pdx). I wasn&apos;t doing anything so I said &quot;Sure, what is it?&quot; and he tells me he needs a script to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy over the entire CVS tree from the CVSROOT&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check out the latest code from each module in each CVS tree, and package it up&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also, pants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote it. It&apos;s neat. Hadn&apos;t done any shell scripting in a while, but this was relaxing and it gave me a chance to exercise some of my skills, which is always good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
