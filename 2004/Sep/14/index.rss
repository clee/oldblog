    <description>&lt;p&gt;The ride back from Long Island last night was unbelievable. The fog was incredible - I literally could not see three cars ahead of me at times. Not that there were any cars on the road anyway, but still - the visibility levels hit some pretty scary depths on the 495. And the temperature dropped pretty low as well; not sure if that was a side effect of the speed I was driving at, or both windows being down, or what, but it was pretty crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weekend in general was just a crazy wild ride. Got to see Kyle again, which is always a good time. I&apos;m proud that he&apos;s my friend. His pimposity has reached awesome new highs, and I have to salute him; we had a blast. Watched the Punisher on DVD as well, which was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everything went perfectly, of course, but hey. Life goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
