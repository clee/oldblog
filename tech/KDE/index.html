			<p><a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/1465">Fab</a>: NetworkManager actually has a pretty well-designed separation between the front-end and the back-end; the only problem stalling us from being able to do cool things with it right now is that we have no working DBUS bindings for KDE3 (so nobody can easily write a Kicker applet to interface with NetworkManager to use on their desktop <b>today</b>), and KDE4 doesn't actually have anything usable at this point, whatsoever.</p><p>I brought this up at aKademy - aseigo and I were basically ready to go ahead with it but we got sidetracked with window icon previews in the window list on the desktop pager hover tooltip. (Try saying that five times fast.)</p><p>In theory, somebody could write the applet using the DBUS API from C, but the current Qt bindings in the DBUS tree are pretty much worthless, so it's not going to be pretty either way.<br /></p>

			<p>We had a discussion in #kde-devel earlier about what KDE's requirements for a build system are. What are the current problems we have with autoconf/automake/libtool?

(Ask RangerRick or js about them on IRC, or email them.)</p><p>Just because we're using auto* and friends doesn't mean that our code works; as a matter of fact, RangerRick noted that so far, all of his issues with the Mac port of the work-in-progress KDE4 have been build issues, and none of them have been code-related yet.  </p><p>This is clearly a problem and since KDE4 is an aggressive new major release, we should solve it in the KDE4 timeframe.

			<p>One of the things I keep thinking about with KDE's much-vaunted CVS->SVN migration is... why don't we just leave the CVS server up as it is, and screw the whole "import the entire history of our repository into SVN" idea?</p><p>Think about it.</p><p>The cvs2svn script is good. Don't get me wrong - it's pretty impressive. But we've done some evil to our CVS repository - manually moved files, etc, and cvs2svn is not perfect; why don't we just leave the CVS server up and running read-only and import a snapshot (say, 3.4) into SVN without trying to drag all of the history along?</p><p>People who want to pull absolutely 100% accurate checkouts of a given revision can do it with the old tools and we can evaluate subversion without having to deal with any possible issues brought up by weirdness caused by cvs2svn.</p><p>I personally think this may be the smartest way to move forward, but I'm sure that others have differing opinions.

			<p>So geiseri hosted a hackfest at his place in PA last weekend. I showed up and brought manyoso with me; Nadeem Hasan came down, as did Mirko Boehm. Zack Rusin was already there, and it was fairly awesome. My only regret is that, despite the awesome time I had, I didn't get any hacking done since I don't have a laptop anymore.</p><p>Oh, yeah.</p><p>Somebody broke into my car a couple of weeks ago. Shattered the quarter glass behind the passenger window, and stole my IBM Thinkpad T41 out of the back seat. (Well, the footspace behind the passenger seat. Close enough.) I have no idea where the laptop is, and, while the police have been informed, they haven't really proven to be that useful.</p><p>End result: I have no laptop. So I was fairly useless at the hackfest as far as actual hacking goes. And my workstation at home is set up in a rather decidedly non-ergonomic fashion, which means that I can't really use the computer for extended periods of time without standing up and stretching out my knees.</p><p>I do have plans for stuff to hack on and plenty of things to keep me busy though. So don't worry about that, guys. Just need my replacement laptop to come in from work, and maybe I can pick up a computer desk with my next paycheck somehow.</p><p>Realized that I haven't blogged in a while, so these entries are a bit longer than the usual length. I doubt anybody will really care that much, but yeah. Maybe I can kick myself into blogging more frequently once I get some Tack hacking done again.<br /></p>

		<div class="text">
			<p>I blogged earlier about KDE potentially moving our repositories from the ancient and archaic CVS system to the new hotness known as <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>.</p><p>This time around, I've got more ammunition for discussion and a lot of thoughts about the relative strengths and weaknesses of each system as they apply to KDE. Hopefully other KDE developers will read these notes and at least take them into consideration when discussing our eventual move away from CVS.</p><p>So - first off, a few words about CVS. CVS has served KDE faithfully for years, and has been (for us) fairly stable and reliable. It doesn't change much. And, believe it or not, CVS does have some strengths. <br /><table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3"><tr><th colspan="2">CVS</th></tr><tr><th>Strengths</th><th>Weaknesses</th></tr><tr><td><ul><li>Ubiquitous (practically every operating system on every platform can run CVS)</li><li>Relatively light on resource usage</li><li>Comparitively light on disk usage</li><li>It actually <b>works</b></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Branching is painful</li><li>Lacking in certain very basic features</li><li>Lack of atomicity with commits; no transactions</li><li>Not very well-optimized for low-bandwidth</li><li>Difficulty handling binary files properly</li></ul></td></tr></table></p><p>Now, Subversion fixes a few of these issues, but at the core Subversion's goal is to be a better CVS than CVS. It doesn't implement wire compatibility, nor can it natively use the old CVS repository format; instead, it maintains the same ideas as CVS (namely the same centralized development model), as well as a compatible command-set except for areas where changes are needed to deal with Subversion having features that CVS doesn't.<br /><table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3"><tr><th colspan="2">Subversion</th></tr><tr><th>Strengths</th><th>Weaknesses</th></tr><tr><td><ul><li>Little to no learning curve if you already know CVS</li><li>Atomic commits, with <a title="If the commit fails - client kills it, connection dies, etc - it doesn't end up halfway in the repository. Instead, it fails completely.">transactions</a></li><li>File renames</li><li>More efficient wire protocol for <a title="Transmits diffs instead of full files whenever possible, both server-to-client and client-to-server">low-bandwidth</a></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Disk usage is significantly higher than CVS for a converted repository</li><li>Subversion seems slower than CVS, quite a bit so in some cases</li><li>Not nearly as ubiquitous as CVS (yet)</li><li>Resource usage is relatively higher than CVS</li></ul></td></tr></table></p><p>And, just for good measure (basically, because I like it) I'll throw in a little bit about Arch, also known as 'tla'.<br /><table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3"><tr><th colspan="2">Arch</th></tr><tr><th>Strengths</th><th>Weaknesses</th></tr><tr><td><ul><li>Super intelligent merging support</li><li>GPG signing support</li><li>Seamless inter-archive branching support</li><li>Very easy on server-side resources</li><li>Offline commits</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Relatively high learning curve</li><li>Nowhere near as ubiquitous as even Subversion</li><li>Rather difficult and verbose user-interface</li><li>Disk usage is also higher than CVS</li><li>Speed is not very impressive</li></ul></td></tr></table></p><p>What does this mean for KDE?</p><p>I think that Subversion is a much more natural fit for KDE than Arch. We have a very centralized development model; however, the disk usage issue is depressing to think about. I ran a test conversion of our kdelibs repository from CVS to Subversion, once using the Berkeley database backend and once using the new fsfs backend; the bdb backend takes up 1194M of space, and the fsfs backend takes 1130M of space on my system. In comparison, the CVS repository takes up 281M of space for the same revisions. Some of the Subversion developers have offered me a few hints, but I cringe to think about how difficult the migration will be for a <b>large</b> module such as kde-i18n.<br /></p>

			<p>So there's some pretty <a href="http://lists.kde.org/?t=109726039700003&r=1&w=2">heavy discussion</a> on the kde-core-devel list about migrating from CVS to Subversion for the entire KDE project.</p><p>All I can say is, the sooner, the better.</p><p>Of course, I'm very much of the mind that tla &gt; svn &gt; cvs, but as long as we're moving up the stack, even if marginally, it's still progress. Plus, svn has the feature that it is much more like tla than CVS is, and the cvs2svn guys have already written an impressive script to convert the ancient RCS files into changesets. And since both Subversion and Arch are changeset-oriented... I'm very excited. In my mind at least, it shouldn't be too insanely difficult to migrate from svn to tla in the future...<br /></p>

			<p>I wrote a new style from scratch a long time ago called Asteroid. It was done half as a gag, and half because I was bored. I also decided to implement it from scratch (instead of following my usual method of hacking on the dotNET code) so that I could provide a better platform for others to build their styles on. (As an aside, I also took out all of the Asteroid-specific code and put it into a Skeleton style, which is BSD-licensed and available on my site).</p><p>However, being that I'm lazy and Asteroid got Good Enough TM for me to use without being too annoyed with it, Asteroid was put on hold at version 0.2. Until today, that is. I got an email from David Chester, with the Munjoy Linux distribution, and he has implemented much more of the widget style code, and submitted his changes back to me. (As an aside, Munjoy looks quite nifty, and I'm going to have to try it out. KDE + Debian = Righteous.)</p><p>So, yeah. I started something neat, and somebody else picked it up and ran with it. Open Source code rocks.<br /></p>

			<p>so now that I have a local kerberos server, and it hands out tickets like a champ, and life is good, the next (logical) step is to want to have single-sign-on for things like (say) my email.</p><p>KDE has a custom ground-up SASL implementation that supports LOGIN, PLAIN, CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5, but not GSSAPI (which is a layer on top of Kerberos). I took a look at it and decided that I could implement a GSSAPI function for the KDE SASL implementation. I had no idea that it'd be so damned frustrating. why is GSSAPI so complicated, and poorly-designed to boot?</p><p>if you think I'm joking, or complaining about nothing - the main function, gss_init_sec_context, takes THIRTEEN parameters. that's a lot of margin-for-error. one would think they might use custom data structures, ones more complicated than the standard struct with a void pointer and an int to indicate the length of the data, but no. of course not.</p><p>oh well. when I'm done, KDE will have a GSSAPI implementation, meaning that it should Just Work (TM) with any Kerberized service that uses SASL. Namely, this means IMAP servers and probably a few SMTP servers - having single-sign-on for these services will be great.<br /></p>
