    <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate Internet Explorer. If you happen to be unfortunate enough to be using it, please, consider either upgrading to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mozilla.org/firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; or convincing the people in charge over in IT to give it a shot. Firefox actually supports web standards - those neat things that make it possible for people to write all sorts of really neat web pages, without having to resort to evil nasty hacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what this page looks like under IE5. My closest guess would be that it looks like a plate full of ass, and if it does, then too bad. There are at least a half dozen other web browsers you can use that will render this site properly, and if all else fails you could always upgrade to IE6 since that works for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, my &quot;compatibility&quot; with IE is going to consist of hiding things that the browser doesn&apos;t understand, instead of trying to get it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
