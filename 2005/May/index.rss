    <title>vmware update</title>
    <link>http://c133.org/blog/tech/vmware_update.html</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2005 15:00 -1000</pubDate>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Just thought I&apos;d post a quick update about my situation re: my computer at home, since I know you all care so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out, after wiping my partition table and starting over from scratch and getting Linux back up (which took all of about ten minutes), Windows installed fine from the SATA DVD drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how this is possible - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.windowsitpro.com/Article/ArticleID/41058/41058.html&quot;&gt;this page says&lt;/a&gt;, and I quote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Out of the box, no current Windows version, including Windows Server 2003, supports SATA drives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My best guess is that the BIOS enables some sort of PATA emulation that Windows can use to find that drive. That&apos;s the only thing that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I was a little hard on VMware, to be honest. I mean, I was using a feature that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/disks_instraw_ws.html&quot;&gt;they specifically warn against most people using&lt;/a&gt;, while running 32-bit VMware on a 64-bit (unsupported variant of a) host OS. I&apos;m reminded of a quote here... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;People who do stupid things with hazardous materials often die.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, I didn&apos;t exactly die, but I think it somewhat applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Red Hat, my employer, has a site license for VMware. (Well, either a site license, or an assload of Workstation licenses, I&apos;m not really sure what the details are.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided &quot;Hey, why not play with the new release? You&apos;ve got new hardware. Maybe VMware will run acceptably fast on it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man, what a fucking brilliant idea that was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backstory: I haven&apos;t booted Windows in a few months, not since Doom3 came out and wasn&apos;t available initially on Linux. However, I have some shiny new devices in the new box, including a SATA DVD burner, which so far doesn&apos;t seem to work with Linux very well. Ubuntu&apos;s kernel enables SATA ATAPI support, which Jeff Garzik tells me is a bad naughty thing of them to do since it&apos;s not ready yet. Which results in my ability to *see* the drive on /dev/scd0, if the planets align properly, but I can&apos;t actually use it for much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This machine doesn&apos;t have a floppy drive, since I&apos;m a cheap bastard, and I happen to agree with Apple on this one. Fuck floppies. They should have died a long time ago. I also refuse to run Windows XP - I bought and paid for Windows 2000, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, and it&apos;s the last release of Windows that I really plan on ever using. Windows 2000, being rather old, has some deficiencies, however. Like not having SATA support in the installer (unless you load a driver from a floppy, which I don&apos;t have).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think to myself, &quot;Hey! VMware! Raw disk support! It used to work pretty well, why not try doing an installation from a virtual machine into a physical disk? You can use the VM to download drivers, then create a new hardware profile, reboot into it, and maybe that&apos;ll work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAHAHAHAA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s just say that this was probably the worst idea I&apos;ve had all night, even worse than eating that third slice of pizza. My partition table on /dev/hda now looks like this, thanks to VMware:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Disk /dev/hda: 41.1 GB, 41174138880 bytes&lt;br /&gt;16 heads, 63 sectors/track, 79780 cylinders&lt;br /&gt;Units = cylinders of 1008 * 512 = 516096 bytes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn&apos;t look like a partition table&lt;br /&gt;Probably you selected the wrong device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System&lt;br /&gt;/dev/hda1   ?      216399     1904881   850995205   72  Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.&lt;br /&gt;/dev/hda2   ?      723265     1262922   271987362   74  Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Partition 2 does not end on cylinder boundary.&lt;br /&gt;/dev/hda3   ?      167316      167316           0   65  Novell Netware 386&lt;br /&gt;Partition 3 does not end on cylinder boundary.&lt;br /&gt;/dev/hda4         2671568     2671619       25817+   0  Empty&lt;br /&gt;Partition 4 does not end on cylinder boundary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partition table entries are not in disk order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not even sure what to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For those of you wondering why I wanted to play with Windows in the first place - SATA DVD burner. I know that I can install Win2K drivers for the SATA chipset, and I know that the DVD burner will *probably* work there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;My new toys arrived today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s one &lt;a href=&quot;http://c133.org/img/pc60.jpg&quot;&gt;Lian-Li PC-60&lt;/a&gt;, one Chaintech VNF4/Ultra motherboard, and one Athlon64 3000+ CPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This machine is officially fast enough to scare me. I can play Doom3 at my monitor&apos;s native resolution (1680x1050) and the frame rate doesn&apos;t drop below 60fps even with baddies on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only other goodies I need to complete this box are a couple of 400G SATA drives. The Hitachi model is only $275 on NewEgg, which means that it&apos;s now possible to put over 1TB of storage into a box for under $1000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holy shit life is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Renewed my lease at my apartment for another year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I&apos;m happy enough with Royal Crest. It&apos;s just that Cambridge is a lot cooler. If caillon and I had been able to get our act together earlier, things might have been different, but oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, living at the same address for more than twelve months feels like some sort of a victory. Therefore, I win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m feeling much healthier. Maybe the title is a bit of a misnomer, since we all know that I&apos;m not anywhere close to &quot;normal,&quot; but my throat seems to be almost completely healed and it no longer hurts to breathe, eat, or swallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By some assorted cleverness, I have managed to secure an upgrade to an Athlon 64 and a much nicer new case, for a net cost of about $20 to me. I&apos;m excited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to pick a project to get back into KDE hacking with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much else is new. Found a really awesome pizza place a few weeks ago, and have been eating there regularly. A $10 pizza lasts me two or three days, which is awesome. Saving money is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
