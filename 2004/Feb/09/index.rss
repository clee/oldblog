    <title>oh how I hate gssapi</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;so now that I have a local kerberos server, and it hands out tickets like a champ, and life is good, the next (logical) step is to want to have single-sign-on for things like (say) my email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KDE has a custom ground-up SASL implementation that supports LOGIN, PLAIN, CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5, but not GSSAPI (which is a layer on top of Kerberos). I took a look at it and decided that I could implement a GSSAPI function for the KDE SASL implementation. I had no idea that it&apos;d be so damned frustrating. why is GSSAPI so complicated, and poorly-designed to boot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;if you think I&apos;m joking, or complaining about nothing - the main function, gss_init_sec_context, takes THIRTEEN parameters. that&apos;s a lot of margin-for-error. one would think they might use custom data structures, ones more complicated than the standard struct with a void pointer and an int to indicate the length of the data, but no. of course not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;oh well. when I&apos;m done, KDE will have a GSSAPI implementation, meaning that it should Just Work (TM) with any Kerberized service that uses SASL. Namely, this means IMAP servers and probably a few SMTP servers - having single-sign-on for these services will be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;so I finished setting up a working LDAP server here at home. with Kerberos, for that single-sign-on goodness. I can see why people dig this. I can also see why people fucking hate it. awesome features, complete and total pain in the ass to set up. honestly, I think I probably would rather have installed openBSD, and that&apos;s saying a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;but now that it&apos;s working, and I have it set up, I am a golden god.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
