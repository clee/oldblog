    <description>&lt;p&gt;HDTV service was installed and turned on yesterday. Still feeling a little sick and not so hot, but I&apos;m going in to work today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Smallville season looks &lt;b&gt;good&lt;/b&gt; so far. I love that show. I have to admit, I didn&apos;t really like Lois at first but her personality has already started growing on me. I just wish that Comcast offered the WB in HD up here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
