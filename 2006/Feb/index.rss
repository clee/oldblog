    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://airlied.livejournal.com/22700.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;user info&quot; /&gt;airlied&lt;/a&gt;: I&apos;d be a lot less annoyed with companies like ATI if they shipped drivers (even proprietary ones!) that actually supported their latest cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The R5xx-series cards have been out for &lt;i&gt;MONTHS&lt;/i&gt; now and there&apos;s still no acceleration, 2D &lt;b&gt;or&lt;/b&gt; 3D, Open Source &lt;b&gt;or&lt;/b&gt; proprietary. Good job, ATI!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I&apos;m excited about the way that things are headed, and I&apos;m really glad that other people are getting excited, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the people who were wondering - the &quot;AI&quot; in &quot;AIGLX&quot; stands for Accelerated Indirect - it&apos;s basically required to do a lot of neat things like using the local card to render OpenGL from a remote application. It also enables all sorts of kick-ass effects like the new bling in metacity and compiz (which doesn&apos;t work yet, but it&apos;s only a matter of time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
