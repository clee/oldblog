    <description>&lt;p&gt;WARNING: Story involving earwax follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a week and a half ago, I took a shower and got some water stuck in my ear. This has happened many times before, but I was impatient this particular time and instead of waiting for it to drain I decided to take matters into my own hands. I grabbed a Q-tip and plunged it deep into my ear, and instead of freeing the water and making everything better I apparently pressed something shut and turned off my hearing in my left ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition of half-deafness lasted for over a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday (well, the night before last night, anyway, but at like 3AM) I got so pissed off that I started digging at the inner canal of my left ear trying desperately to shake out or loosen up whatever it was that had gotten caught. Amazingly enough, I succeeded, without causing any damage. And now I can hear again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s amazing how much I took the whole being-able-to-hear-from-both-ears thing for granted. I shall never do so again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
