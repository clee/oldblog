    <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a pretty cool day for me because a project I&apos;ve been working on at work is finally released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://people.redhat.com/zcerza/dogtail/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;rapemewithachainsawthanks&quot; src=&quot;http://people.redhat.com/zcerza/dogtail/images/dogtail01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dogtail!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;dogtail is a framework written in Python which makes it easy to write scripts to automate graphical applications. It uses AT-SPI which means that (for now) it doesn&apos;t work with KDE, but I fought the good fight to make sure that it has no GNOME dependencies so that hopefully there will be a chance of KDE adopting it in the future. Now that we&apos;ve finally gotten the release out the door, I plan to track KDE svn and write scripts for KDE4 apps. Ideally, we&apos;ll have KDE4 support before KDE4 is actually released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I know that there&apos;s a tool from &lt;a href=&quot;http://wwww.klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se/&quot;&gt;KDAB&lt;/a&gt; which allows one to automate KDE apps, but it&apos;s not Open Source and it only works with KDE; dogtail supports anything that we can see through AT-SPI, which includes OpenOffice.org and Mozilla-based applications as well as, hopefully, KDE4.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
