    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s 5AM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m blind, and it&apos;s dark. Music from Metal Gear Solid 3 floats through my apartment and yet I can still hear the drops of blood hitting the surface of the water as my nose drains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nosebleeds have been a pretty common occurrence for about as long as I can remember; I&apos;ve had them ever since I was a little kid. They&apos;ve started back up recently, after I had gone several months without having any. I&apos;m not sure exactly why but I think it might be somewhat related to drinking soda. (While I was caffeine-free for that six weeks or so, I didn&apos;t have a single nosebleed.) I&apos;ve recently started drinking the stuff again, since it&apos;s easier to drink it than not to, but I may have to rethink that choice in light of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Metal Gear Solid 3, I finally sat down and played through the rest of it. I had gotten farther along than I thought before I stopped playing it back in November, and the game is just amazing. I can&apos;t think of enough words to describe how much I enjoyed playing through this game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
