    <title>new lease</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Renewed my lease at my apartment for another year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I&apos;m happy enough with Royal Crest. It&apos;s just that Cambridge is a lot cooler. If caillon and I had been able to get our act together earlier, things might have been different, but oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, living at the same address for more than twelve months feels like some sort of a victory. Therefore, I win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m feeling much healthier. Maybe the title is a bit of a misnomer, since we all know that I&apos;m not anywhere close to &quot;normal,&quot; but my throat seems to be almost completely healed and it no longer hurts to breathe, eat, or swallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By some assorted cleverness, I have managed to secure an upgrade to an Athlon 64 and a much nicer new case, for a net cost of about $20 to me. I&apos;m excited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to pick a project to get back into KDE hacking with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much else is new. Found a really awesome pizza place a few weeks ago, and have been eating there regularly. A $10 pizza lasts me two or three days, which is awesome. Saving money is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
