    <description>&lt;p&gt;today&apos;s quote (from Tia):&lt;br /&gt;&quot;hell if i would have known that you were moving i would have handcuffed you to a bed and stuck you in a basement somewhere so you couldn&apos;t leave&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;good to know that I have friends who would abduct me and keep me in a basement. definitely good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to Boston on Wednesday last week for an interview that I had at a community health center in the city. I got a call the same day from Red Hat asking if I wanted to come in for an interview the next day, so I told them &quot;Of course!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the interview went great! I had the most fun I&apos;ve ever had interviewing. I got to meet a bunch of cool guys and I had a blast chatting with them, about all sorts of stuff. they had me show up at 10AM and I was supposed to be done by 3, but they kept me until a little after 4. which hopefully is a good sign, but I don&apos;t want to get my hopes _too_ far up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the hospital was basically a dead end, though. they don&apos;t have any positions for the IS department, but they swore that they would call me as soon as they do. they did seem to be pretty impressed though, so I think it went well even if nothing comes of it. it&apos;s experience, anyway. which is always good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;so, where to begin - it&apos;s been way too long since I wrote anything down; my apologies to anyone out there reading but I haven&apos;t had nearly as much internet access as usual lately, and I can&apos;t seem to find any decent blogging software for OS X so I may end up having to write my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;in other news.... Steph has decided not to move out here. shocking, I know. it&apos;s actually kind of sad, because she&apos;s really cool, and I was kinda looking forward to her moving out here. on the other hand, it&apos;s rather freeing, and I realized the other day that I&apos;m officially more free right now, at this very moment, than I&apos;ve ever been before in my life. I have no responsibilities to anyone, really - I have no obligations to maintain, no relationships holding me down or keeping me from doing what I want, and it&apos;s sort of a scary place to be. hopefully things will firm up a bit soon; it&apos;s an interesting place to be at, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;have been going to interviews and submitting the resume at tons of places up here. no solid results yet, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
